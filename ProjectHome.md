The GenORMous project takes a simple XML and generates ORM objects that can be used for accessing your database.  The generated objects are simple to use and very efficient.

While you are here take a look at some of the [advantages](Advantages.md) of using GenORMous

Also I'm working up a [tutorial](Tutorial.md) to show how easy it is to use.

**Genormous development is moving along quickly, stay tuned for updates**

I just added the slides from a presentation I did at the Utah Open Source Conference.  Check it out under the downloads tab.

I've added some [API JavaDocs](http://genormous.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/genormous/doc/javadoc/index.html) for the runtime portion of Genormous.

I recently read this [blog post](http://www.iheavy.com/2011/08/26/5-things-are-toxic-to-scalability/) and the number 1 item on his list of toxic things that prevent scalability is the use of ORM solutions.  Well I'm happy to say that Genormous does not suffer from these problems.  Genormous leaves you in the drivers seat when it comes to customizing the SQL.
