#summary Database compatibility

= Database compatibility =

Genormous was initially written and tested against HSQLDB.  With that said the only part of Genormous that is specific to the database is the create SQL statement.  If creating the tables is something you do not care about, Genormous "should" work with most databases.  All operations are standard insert update and delete SQL statements.

In the future I plan on making Genormous explicitly compatible with other databases.  The next databases that I plan on using it with will be Postgres and MySQL in that order.
